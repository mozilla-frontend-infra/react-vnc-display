## Getting started

You can install `react-vnc-display` via Yarn or npm:

```bash
# If using Yarn:
yarn add react-vnc-display

# If using npm:
npm install --save react-vnc-display
```

The component from react-vnc-display is `VncDisplay`. This module can be required via ES imports, CommonJS require, or UMD.

```js
import VncDisplay from 'react-vnc-display';

// using require
const VncDisplay = require('react-vnc-display');
```

### Usage

After importing the component, it can be rendered with the required `url` prop:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { render } from 'react-dom';
import VncDisplay from 'react-vnc-display';

render((
  <VncDisplay url="wss://some-remote-display:5991/path" />
), document.getElementById('root'));
```

By default the `VncDisplay` will start out with dimensions of 1280x720, but will be resized to the dimensions of the
display once the connection has been established. You can pass noVNC callbacks as props to `VncDisplay` to customize
this and additional behavior.

### Props

`VncDisplay` accepts a single required property of URL:

| Property | Type | Required? | Description |
|:---|:---|:---:|:---|
| `url` | String | âœ“ | The URL for which to create a remote VNC connection. Should include the protocol, host, port, and path. |

In addition, most of the properties available to [noVNC](https://github.com/novnc/noVNC)
can be provided and will be passed through to the noVNC instance. _Here are a few useful props:_

| Property | Type | Required? | Description |
|:---|:---|:---:|:---|
| `onClipboard` | `func` |  | Execute a function when the VNC connection's clipboard updates. |
| `onUpdateState` | `func` |  | Execute a function when the state of the VNC connection changes. |
| `shared` | `bool` |  | Specify whether a VNC connection should disconnect other connections before connecting. |
| `wsProtocols` | `arrayOf(string)` |  | Specify a list of WebSocket protocols this connection should support. |
